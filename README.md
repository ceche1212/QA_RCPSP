# Quantum Annealing for the RCPSP

The following repository includes all the RCPSP instances (Disjunctive, Cummulative and Middle) from sizes of 3,4,5,6,7 and 8 non dummy activities. The repository also includes two jupyter notebooks with the code to perform forward and reverse annealing to solve the RCPSP. To be able to run the code, the user must first create a D-wave account via https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/login/?next=/leap/ and then proceed to insert their API access tokens in the notebooks.
